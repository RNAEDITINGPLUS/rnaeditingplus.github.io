## Welcome to RNA Editing Plus

Due to funding issues, RNA Editing Plus now cannot afford the maintenance fees. As a consequence, we have to shutdown the web server. To minimize the lost, we have developed an offline version of REP, which can be cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/RNAEDITINGPLUS/main).

### How to deploy RNA Editing Plus

RNA Editing Plus can be divided into two parts: web interface and computing nodes. The web interface needs the support from Apache and MySQL, while computing nodes require a lot of dependent packages. To simplify the installation, we provide two install scripts to handle this issue, here is the tutorial:

```
git clone https://github.com/RNAEDITINGPLUS/main.git
cd main
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```
